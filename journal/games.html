            <h2>Game Design Research</h2>
            <p>After reading the article "Game Design Best UX Practices" by Amir Dori, I enjoyed reading about the many subtle decisions that game designers make to increase the time users spend on their games. For example, the most strikingly simple one I saw was simply placing the button that you want the user to make on the right side of the screen when they are faced with a choice. An example shown in the aritcle was an Angry Bird's pop up screen that prompted "Are you sure you want to quit?" with an "X" button on the right and a check on the left side. Usually, for yes/no answers like this one, as a general rule, the yes option is on the right. However, the author makes a point that it is beneficial to place the button option that most benefits your game on the right. In this case, the game designer wants the user to keep playing.</p>
            <p>These subtle and sneaky decisions make me wonder if the user may develop some annoyance over time as they notice how they are essentially being used by the game to make choices that usually involve some monetary incentive for the game. </p>
