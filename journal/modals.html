            <h2>Modal Design</h2>
            <p>The article, “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,” by Naema Baskanderi, outlines the best practices for using a modal, or a pop-up window on digital devices, in a way that is best understood by the user. I was surprised to learn how little users tend to pay attention to pop-up windows. In my experience, log-in screens tend to be the most common ones I've come across. I also noticed that the article was from ten years ago today and yet still very relevant. Observing the fast evolution of digital screens, it was interesting to see that there are some best practices that seem to last a long time.</p>
