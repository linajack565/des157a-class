            <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
            <p>One rarely seen photo is a black-and-white image of women on a boat, seemingly conducting scientific research. While browsing the National Geographic website, I was drawn to the photos featured in their history section. When you first open the website, a striking image appears of two women observing an old-time machine. As the reader scrolls down, they encounter images of women working both on a boat and in what looks like research rooms, as well as detailed illustrations of underwater sea creatures. Just by looking at these photos, the reader can piece together the story of the women who helped discover marine animals in the 1930s—a time when technology was far less advanced than what we have today. These photos are incredibly effective in telling the story of these researchers, with each image offering a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes efforts that went into these groundbreaking discoveries.</p>
