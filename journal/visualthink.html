            <h2>Partner's Idea (Jay)</h2>
            <p>While my partner has yet to take a photo of their idea, they shared their vision about what they would like their Every Picture project to be about. One idea is to line up their collection of ID's that they've kept since they were a child - showing how they've changed over time into adulthood. I thought this idea was very original and could be a very personal portfolio piece that viewers can know Jay on a more personal level. <br> Another interesting idea they had in mind was to set up a "crime scene" with their stuffed animals. I found this idea playful but maybe not as personal as the ID idea. To make the crime scene more compelling, I think Jay could consider each stuffed animals' meaning to them and how that ties into their motive for the "murder."

            <p>For my Every Picture project, I would like to share my background in dance. I realized that many of the dance belongings I own are from when my ballerina days that are sitting at home in the corner of my room. While I no longer go to ballet classes, I think dance has had a big impact on who I am today as it served as a creative outlet and community for me growing up and into college. Some pieces have positive and negative memories associated with them which I would like to communicate with the viewer through my image. I chose this image out of the three sketches I made because the perspective is very close to the items, making them seem more intimate and interactable.</p>
