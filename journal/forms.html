            <h2>Form Design</h2>
            <p>After reading the article, “Best practices for form design,” by Salim Ansari, I was reminded how detail-oriented a simple form can be to ensure usability. There were many examples of bad form design that I’ve come across that I was reminded of from this article. For instance, a design mistake that I take for granted is the Placeholder Text examples where once the user clicks on the box, the placeholder text that held the example disappears and the user is left trying to remember what it said before. Although it is a small detail, having to even think more than a few seconds can be tiresome, especially for users who have filled many forms in their lifetime. Forms aren’t necessarily the most exciting things in the world. </p>

            <p>The article also reminded me of a form I recently filled out - the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. Over the years, filling out this form has become easier due to better UX practices. Before, I would have to attend FAFSA workshops to understand what I was doing. But this could have also been influenced by my familiarity with it over time.</p>
